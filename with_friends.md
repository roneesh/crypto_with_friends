## 1. Introduction ##

Crypto with friends is a lab based introduction to cryptography that is solely targeted at the beginner. There are a TON of resources out there for learning crypto, but the most common ones often come up pretty short in explaining what concept you're actually studying and how it fits into the bigger picture of cryptography. This series was inspired by Matasano's CryptoPals challenges, and while they are very informative, they are very dense. While doing those challenges it can be hard to figure out what you're doing and why. For programmers of less experience, attempting them will likely cause some frustration as they butt their ahead against both entirely new crypto concepts and also new parts of their langauge they are encountering. No doubt that is a recipe for growth as a programmer, but, why can't the growth come without the frustration? What if a series framed the crypto concepts more clearly, then budding crypto learner could move quicker, isn't that better? A second reason for this series is that most challenges online are for one person to do alone, which is strange because Crypto is inherently meant for two people (even if you're only encrypting your personal files, the second person is you in some months when you decrypt those files). Therefore the labs in this series will be for two people to do together.

## 3. With Friends ##

This series is meant to be done with a friend. All exercises are for two people, and will be based around sending messages to each other. If you're on your own, you can be the second person, but the most fun will be had if you're sending messages to another computer and receiving messages from another computer. If you don't have someone to do these with, my advice is to find someone and ask them to join you! You'd be surprised how many people will be into the idea of learning beginner friendly Crypto!
